MSCS Thesis
===========

Thesis code for credit toward masters degree in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University. 

Code
----

*	toy.py: implements / demonstrates distribution -> distribution regression for 
	data drawn from distribution functions of a single variable
*	dtdr.py: implements scalable distribution -> distribution regression
*	manage_files.py: tools for scaling, binning, and otherwise manipulating large
	data files
* 	math_helpers.py: mathematical helper functions for use in distribution-to-distribution regression
*	pll_helpers.py: tools for parallelizing coefficient computation
*	my_parser.cpp: custom parser for extracting particles from simulation binaries

Requirements
-----------

This project requires the following scientific computing libraries:

* numpy
* scipy
* sklearn
* pylab (if making plots)
